In the era of the Internet of Things (IoT), data logging plays a crucial role in monitoring
environmental and system parameters. Temperature sensors are among the most
commonly used IoT components to measure and record ambient conditions for applications
such as weather stations, smart homes, and industrial automation.
This project demonstrates how Linux can be used as a platform to log temperature data
using Python. The system collects data in a simulated environment, generates random but
realistic temperature readings. The data is stored in a CSV file and visualized using Python
plotting libraries like matplotlib and pandas.
The experiment highlights how Linux provides an ideal environment for IoT data
acquisition, logging, and visualization using open-source tools.
